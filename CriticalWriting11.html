        UI/UX Critical Writing Analysis
       
    </h1>
<p class="e-content">
    User Experience design is a section of HCI (Human Computer Interactions) which aims to do more than ensure the user is able to complete the task by questioning what would make completing the task more enjoyable for the user. UX, is a user centred design method as opposed to a more task centred design method. This method ensures that the product is not only free of bugs/usability issues but that it is also enjoyable to use. Experience involves both what the user is feeling as well as the state of the product whilst the user is interacting with it(Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2009).

My website makes use of a singular column layout. I chose this over a multi-column layout even though it allows for more design options in terms of placement of text and images, it increases complexity making it more challenging for the reader to process information (Revilla & Crow, 2009). I did not want my user to feel overwhelmed by heaps of information. Therefore I decided to chunk my work into paragraphs on a single column. Chunking is the act of grouping together relative information into small and readable groups of text. Chunking permits large text to be skimmed quickly, which lets the reader perceive information “perceptually as opposed to cognitively” (Revilla & Crow, 2009). In terms of assistive technologies, I also found that placing my readings and reflections in a single column made it easier for screen readers (a larger variety of screen readers can read single column text as opposed to multi-column text (Multiple Columns in HTML, 2022))  to process information to users with visual impairments.

<p class="e-content">
    Semiotic engineering can be seen as a theoretical based approach to design which sees the user interface as a way of communication between the designer and the user. This mode of communication can be seen through the use of icons. Icons do not have a specified meaning, yet the user’s understanding of these icons is dependent on their previous experience of them (if any) and of the actions that take place after interacting with those icons. The user’s previously associated meaning with one’s iconography may change after engaging with this new project’s iconography’s. However, this will depend on how standardised the icon previously is. For example, a stop sign will always mean stop to the user, even though it may mean go on another product the user may have recently engaged with.
</p>

<p class="e-content">On my website I made the mistake of assuming the icons I placed in my navigation bar were clear enough to be understood. However, they were too ambiguous to be understood without text. For example, I had two different icons for the reflections tab for my website versus the reflections tab for the readings. The two icons looked too similar, representing a book but from different perspectives. This made it difficult for my user to learn which tabs directed them where through repeated interaction with my website. As well as what the difference between the icons were when initially interacting with my site.</p>

<p class="e-content">“Designer and user communicate through the hypermedia within a social and cultural context” (Toppano & Roberto, 2009). Francisco-Revilla and Crow, point out two cases of hypermedia, that being “apadaptive hypermedia” and “spatial hypermedia”. Adaptive hypermedia is defined as systems which adapt to the needs of the user, their goals as well as their preferences. Spatial hypermedia is defined as the user’s ability to recognise how information is reliant on the spatial structure in which it is presented as well as the user’s ability to reposition elements on the page (Revilla & Crow, 2009). In the case of my website, in relational to spatial hypermedia. On the development sections of my webpage, I used carousels to display images of my work. In the game development section, I used the carousel to display and explain different variations I had made of my game so that the user does not look at all of them at once and think they’re the same variation, but instead can see the difference between each one. On the front-end software development section, I used two carousels side by side. I thought it would make it easier for the user as they could see a side to side comparison of each page from design to implementation.</p>

<p class="e-content">Another informative design point that Francisco-Revilla and Crow mention, is that in their experiments they found that “LAYOUT was strongly correlated with CONTENT”(Revilla & Crow, 2009). This can also be seen in accordance with student research examined in the paper, “User Interface Design Principles for Interaction Design” by Blair-Early and Zender. Blair Early and Zender found that a linear layout structure was good for scientific content. A linear layout gives the designer predominant control of the order in which information is read as each previous piece of information is built upon as the content progresses. A hierarchical structure allows the user to expand upon topics in an order they choose. However, with this structure if all the information on the site needs to be read, users may miss a branch and not read everything related to that tree of information. This layout works well for information that is dependent on references. The matrix, gives the user the most control as it allows them access to multiple options which can be used for comparisons (Blair-Early & Zender, 2008). Within my website I used the matrix (in the form of carousels) on my development/portfolio pages and then I used the linear layout for any reflections or text heavy pieces. However, in the future I would like to change from a linear layout to a hierarchy as it gives the user more control in the case where they may like to navigate to a specific reading (as they would not be forced to skim every reading, they could just navigate directly to the one they would like to read).</p>

<p class="e-content">In terms of improvements I would like to make to my website. I am interested in adding sound as another form of feedback. The sound would be secondary as I would implement it in the navigation bar – therefore primary would be the changing of pages. I may also add it in when someone selects the pixel art, just as a way to make my website more interactive. I will also change the cursor so that users know immediately which parts of the website are interactive and which are not. I also think it would be interesting to add a search box, as it makes it easier for users to navigate around my website and they are also a referential point for users when stuck. Another aspect would be to mark navigation icons in a different colour so that users are always aware of where they are on the website.</p>

<p class="e-content">I added an option for the user to sign in as well as leave a review after playing the game on their version of the site i.e. other users will not be able to see their reviews, as the login is implemented through local storage not a database. I thought this would add another personalised touch (as well as the welcome sign which ‘types’ out the user’s name when they enter the site). When the user registers for an account I only ask for a username/email and a password which must contain a special character, lowercase letter, uppercase, letter, number and at least 8 characters. This increases the complexity of the password making it more difficult to be guessed by another user who does not own/ has not been given access to that account.</p>
