                    <p>Overall, I think my submission for assignment 2 is a lot better than for assignment 1. With this current submission, I focused on improving the experience for my user. I did this by designing my user interface with three different viewports in mind. One for a large screen (desktop), a tablet and a small mobile device. Having three concise viewports in mind made it easier to test.  </p>
                    <p>I also worked on a contact me form, so that when a user enters their information. I am forwarded their email address as well as the message they attached to the contact form. Initially I was working on a login form, but I decided to change it into a contact form as a login did not seem appropriate for a portfolio website.</p>
                <p> With this assignment, I spent most of my time working on feedback from my last assignment. Which I think was beneficial as I managed to fix everything that I received a comment on. I also spent a lot of time redesigning the blog posts page, so that  the user could select which reflection they wanted to read instead of having to scroll through every single one like before. </p>
