                        With this current submission, I focused on improving the experience for my user. I did this by designing my user interface with three different viewports in mind. One for a large screen (desktop), a tablet and a small mobile device. Having three concise viewports in mind made it easier to test.                   
                <p class="e-content"> 
                    I also worked on a contact me form, so that when a user enters their information. I am forwarded their email address as well as the message they attached to the contact form. Initially I was working on a login form, but I decided to change it into a contact form as a login did not seem appropriate for a portfolio website.           
<p class="e-content">
    I worked on creating a more uniform look. I added cards on all the text heavy sections on my Website. I created central cards contained within grids, to make it easier for the user to select which reading/dev project they wanted to read more about. I also carried on with the card theme, when working on my about me section. I had cards for my skills/programming languages, education and jobs. Each card had separate tabs, which the user could click on to gain extra information
</p>
<p class="e-content">
    I also worked on smaller animations to make the website seem more interactive. When the user hovers on the development/ blog posts cards, the background changes colour. When the user hovers over the reflection cards, the images turn into animations.
</p>
<p class="e-content">
    The navigation bar is still so that no matter how far a user scrolls they still have access to the other pages. I also added navigation buttons to the bottom of the side which let the user move between essays.
