    <p class="e-content">I made the navigation bar position fixed so that no matter how far the user scrolls down on a the page, they can use the navigation bar immediately as it will always be positioned at the top of the screen. I also made sure to only use one script to control where the navigation bar was positioned to prevent it from moving around. 
        I decided to add text to the bottom of my icons, as I received feedback that my icons were not distinctive enough to be used without text. I managed to scale this efficiently for a smaller device and was happy with how the navigation bar looked on all three devices. 
        </p>
    
        <p class="e-content">I tried positioning the carousels on the app dev page side by side but struggled, as even with flexboxes the wireframes would move out of position when resized. This looked very noticeable on a phone, where one of the wireframes was clashing with the text. I then changed it back to the original designed, where the carousels are on top of one another. However, this looks better on a smaller device then on a desktop. </p>
    <p class="e-content">I also struggled with flexboxes when designing the blog posts page which is why I decided to have each reading on a vertical layout. As opposed to a 2x3 grid which would have been preferable as that way all the posts would be visible on a single page and the user would not have to scroll down to see all the reflections available.</p>
    <p class="e-content">
        I also decided to completely take out the login/registration pages, as even though I managed to get the page to not go through if there was an error. My error messages would not be shown to the user, despite me using alert to display my messages instead of an element.innerHTML/.value. I also thought it having a login page would not be that appropriate for a portfolio website.
        </p>
    <p class="e-content">When it came to semantic markup I did make an effort to mark all elements on my page with tags that I thought were most appropriate. These tags also made it easier for me to alter text elements with the appropriate css. Initially, I wasn't too sure what content to place in the header and footer section of my website. After doing some research I decided to add references/citations of pixel art from other artists which I had added to my website as well the contact details I was comfortable with recruiters seeing. In the header of each webpage I added the navigation bar.  </p>
