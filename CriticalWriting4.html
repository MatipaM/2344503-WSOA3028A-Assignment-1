        Critical Writing Week 4 - What is a web browser?
    </h1>
     
     
            <p class="e-content">A web/internet browser collects information from the web server when a user requests to access a certain web page. The browser then displays this information on the user’s device. This information is transferred using the HTTP. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP transmits hypermedia documents including HTML. A rendering engine then translates the data from the HTTP and to displays the text/images/videos on the users screen (What is a web browser?, 2022). </p>
            <p class="e-content">Even though it would be ideal for browsers to render information the same way, so that the website you are viewing looks consistent regardless of which web browser you are using. Not all browsers interpret HTML in the same way. Web standards are designed for use by software engineers to encourage consistent functionality between pages on all browsers. Theses web standards are created by experts from multiple companies who come together and agree on how the technologies should work (The web and web standards - Learn web development | MDN, 2022).</p>
                <p class="e-content">Each web page has its own unique URL (uniform Resource Locator) which is used to navigate to and from the page via hyperlinks. Url’s are also known as the web address, they tell the browser where to look for each item in the html and where it goes on the page. Cookies on websites save your information on your computer so that the next time you visit that same website, your preferences, login information is remembered for you (What is a URL? - Learn web development | MDN, 2022).</p>
                <p class="e-content">Browsers are the “user’s gateway” (Yin and Bresnahan, 2005) to internet services, such as online communication and e-commerce. The internet was invented in the 1970’s, however other inventions such as the World Wide Web and web browser made it much more accessible to a wider population. </p>
        <p class="e-content">In 1999, the browser war between Netscape and Microsoft began. The default browser on which Microsoft computers were sold with was Netscape. This was until Microsoft introduced restricted contracts which required Microsoft’s browser to be installed as the default on all Microsoft computers before they could be sold. This contractual agreement was extremely successful for users, as the average user would have found it very convenient for their computer to be delivered with a browser preinstalled. As a preinstalled browser meant they were no knowledge barriers or internet speed issues preventing its installation. Users tend to delay “the adoption of a new browser version” (Yin and Bresnahan, 2005) if they believe they would struggle to install it, or if there is a learning cost involved.</p>
