     "Towards a study of information geographies"(2015) critical reflections 
    </h1>
        <p class="e-content">
            ‘Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’ (2015) aims to highlight where knowledge is being produced from and who is controlling the knowledge we ascribe to certain areas. This article answers which countries have the power to regulate information about themselves as well as the other countries whose knowledge about their own country is being created by outsiders.

    The study focuses on the number of ‘GitHub’ (2008) commits as means to measure “distribution of collaborative coding” (Graham et al. 2015) as well as ‘Wikipedia’ (2001) to measure “[g]eographies of participation” (Graham et al. 2015). Measuring both the code contributed as well as ‘Wikipedia‘(2001) contributions measures both a specialised field of knowledge, that is programming as well as a more generalised field. As ‘Wikipedia’ (2001) allows for pages written about anything or anyone. However, even though these can be seen as way to measure global information contributions, they do not account for the percentage of valuable information committed, as people can post anything even information, they do not believe to be truthful. Moreover, in the case of ‘GitHub’ (2008), it is unlikely all of the commits were submitting code that i.e. was publicly accessible. ‘GitHub’ (2008) was founded on February 8 in 2008 in the United States by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon (GitHub - Wikipedia, 2022).  ‘Wikipedia’ (2001) was founded on January 15, 2001 in the United States by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger (Wikipedia - Wikipedia, 2022).

    Other sites studied in this article include, ‘Google Search’ (1998), ‘OpenStreetMap’ (2006), ‘Semantic Web - Firebase’ (2011) and ‘GeoNames’ (2005). Google Search and Firebase were created in the United States whilst ‘OpenStreetMap’ (2006) and ‘GeoNames’ (2005) were created in the United Kingdom. I would argue that there was some bias when selecting which websites/applications would be used as classifiers for knowledge contributors. All of the applications mentioned prior were created in first world countries. However, I do understand that first world countries are more likely to have the educational facilities as well as financial backing to be able to produce such software. Furthermore, according to the graphs, the locations from which these applications were founded, also have the highest usages of those same applications. For example, the UK appears to have the most nodes in ‘OpenStreetMap’ (2006) where it was created. The same applies for the highest number of placenames where ‘GeoNames ‘was created (in the UK). Most of the sites chosen for study within this article are based in the North e.g. Wikipedia and GitHub. It is possible that knowledge production for other countries in general may be higher, but this information may be posted on their own locally produced sites which may be popular for featuring local information. (However, this article does also study the number of domain names in each area, and most domains (78%) are registered in North America or Europe. (Graham et al. 2015)

    There is a misconception, vocalised by Professor Lawrence Lessig that, “For the first time in a millennium, we have a technology to equalise the opportunity that people have access and participate in the construction of knowledge and culture, regardless of their geographic placing”. The assumption that technology can equalise participation and construction of knowledge, assumes that everyone has equal access to that technology regardless of their geographic placing. It assumes that technology is free and also that it is a human right and therefore can be used by any way and anyhow by anyone who pleases to do so.

    “Information and power thus became intimately intertwined as people capitalised on the value associated with epistemic control” (Graham, Sabbata and Zook, 2015). According to this statement, countries, like the USA have become global dominators of information and therefore power, whilst most African countries are victims of this power imbalance. ‘Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’ (2015) blames this imbalance on a number of factors. Examples include the cost of internet access in each country. It costs between “US$10 and 40 a month” for the average American household to afford internet access. This would be equivalent of 1-4 hours of work for the average American (+/-0.1% of an American’s income). In contrast to the United States, in Africa, internet access costs between “10% and 250% of average income”. This makes it almost 100x more expensive for an African to access the internet than for the average North American.

    Another factor to the disproportionate contribution of information that was not highlighted in great detail in this paper is censorship. Many countries outside of the North/ first world in general limit access to the internet, in order to push political agendas of that country’s ruling party. “Political activism is typically confined to small groups of educated individuals” (Warf, 2011). Some countries are access to the internet is so limited e.g. government may make internet too expensive for the average household to afford, or government may claim that its limiting access to prevent terrorism. Therefore only people who are educated in that particular field may be aware of how limiting the censorship actually is. An example of censorship would be China with their Great Firewall. China promotes their own home-grown search engines which are deemed as ‘politically correct’ (Warf, 2011).

    In Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Mathew A. Zook’s conclusion, they explore how “[i]nformation about places is thus no longer simply mutable and ephemeral, nor is it immutable but fixed within its containers. Instead it is (im)mutable to varying degrees and tethered to locations via digital augmentations” (Graham et al., 2015). Graham et al.’s conclusion acknowledges that countries which hold the most power when it comes to digital information are the ones in control of certain information. Information produced about a certain country may be written or controlled by an outsider. As a result the knowledge produced about these countries will only change when the countries which hold this power decide to change it.
