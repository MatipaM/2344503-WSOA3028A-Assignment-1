            A reflection on, a brief history of Web Robots
</p>
 

<p class="e-content"></pclass> Web robots also known as web crawlers extract all the URL’s (Uniform Resource Locator) on one page (the seeds), follows them and then extracts all the links on the new page. The aim of this process is to learn what is on every site so that when a user searches for information the most appropriate result will be suggested. The links need to be organised in terms of relativity to the user’s search content. Web crawlers are operated by search engines and are search indexers. Search indexing involves the act of marking webpages so they can be found easily later. It is dependent mostly on text but also metadata. Metadata is data that describes other data. In the case of webpages, metadata communicates what each web page is about. Data in the meta title/description is prioritised over text within the page when web crawlers index and organise web pages. Web crawlers use the number of visitors a site gets, the number of other webpages that link to that webpage, as well as other information on the webpage to decide which one to crawl first. This is so the web crawler can prioritise web pages which appear to be most relevant to that piece of information. URL Normalisation is used to try and avoid web crawlers searching the same URL more than once unintentionally (What Is a Web Crawler? | How Web Spiders Work | Cloudflare UK, n.d.). </p>

 

 

<p class="e-content"></p>>The websites and order in which a web crawler will index are dependent on certain policies. These policies influence how often the web crawler checks for updates of the pages’ content. Web crawlers are required to follow a ‘selection policy’. A selection policy specifies which pages the web crawler should download. They also have a ‘re-visit policy’ which tells the crawler when to check for content updates on the webpage. A ‘parallelization policy’ which contains information on how web crawlers should be organised and distributed amongst web pages. A ‘politeness policy’ which guides the crawlers on how to not overload the website when indexing/storing data. This is crucial as crawlers are interacting with so much data, that they have the ability to overwhelm the server. Therefore the politeness policy as well as scheduling, aids in the prevention of web crawlers overloading of a server. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019) </p>

 

 

<p class="e-content"></p>>Web crawlers are required to make requests to the server before they can crawl that website. A webpage can refuse this service by adding the tag “no index” to their landing page. This will mean the site will not show up in the search engine. The tag, “disallow” can also be used in the robots.txt file and the website will not be crawled. Developers may decide to not want their website crawled in cases where only certain people with a link can access their website or to avoid the negative effects of performance, web crawlers can cause the site to have (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019). The robots.txt file contains a list of protocols the crawler must follow when searching/indexing the website. </p>
