     <h1>Farming Simulator</h1>
<section class="grid">
<p>Farming Simulator is a cozy resource management game. Cozy games tend to be defined as casual with an endearing aesthetic such as visual or narrative. We chose to focus on creating a more visually appearing game as opposed to narrative based. Our main mechanics focused on harvesting plants which the player could sell for financial profit. This money could be used either to expand the farm (buying more plots so the farmer could grow more produce at the same time) or purchasing furniture items for their home. We felt adding a home for the player, would not only play well into the visual theme of our game, but would also increase player attachment to the game. As the player is earning money not just to expand their farming business but also to customise their home allowing them to personalise their game play experience.</p>
