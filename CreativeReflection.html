    <h2 class="Heading">
Creative Reflection
    </h2>

<p class="e-content">I imported a font I found online called ‘Lemon Tuesday’ which I used throughout my website for headings and important text. For my main text, i.e., paragraphs and any large sections of text, I used a pre-defined font called Tahoma. I did not think it would have been appropriate to use Lemon Tuesday throughout my blog as it can be difficult to read especially when printed too small. The font ‘Tahoma’ is sans serif which makes it easier to read than a serif font. However, a large downside of Tahoma, is that certain letters when reversed look too alike, e.g., p and q, which may make it difficult for recruiters with dyslexia to navigate through text heavy sections.  </p>
<p class="e-content">I decided to only use two primary fonts as I wanted my website to contain some form of consistency. This is also why I used similar saturation in colours and my main colours only consisted of white, yellow and a pale orange. I made use of mostly neutral colours so that they would not contrast with my work, but instead blend into the background. I chose the background to be a screenshot of my code because I thought it would be fitting as it is a development portfolio. That way recruiters can get an idea of what type of portfolio they are looking at before diving into the main content. Using jQuery, I added an effect which when hovering over the main title (h1 element) the user can change the colour of the title from brown to black depending on their preference.</p>
<p class="e-content">With this iteration of my website, I wanted to focus on a minimalistic look. This was a recurring trend of other developers (especially UI/UX designers). I realised that a minimalistic theme, centres the focus on the product, clearly pointing the recruiter to the most important aspects of my website, which are my development projects and blogs.</p>
<p class="e-content">On my app development page where I speak about the previous internship I just completed at ‘Firtech’, a software development/automation company. I decided to use two carousels side by side. I aligned the pages I had designed using Miro with the pages I had built in with Blazor. I did this because I wanted recruiters to be able to see how each page had developed from my planning process to the outcome. This was quite challenging as during the development process, pages had been moved, deleted and/or added which made it difficult to compare pages exactly. This is also why I decided to use back and forward buttons instead of two automatic carousels so the user can skip extra pages if they would like to see the exact page in planning versus in development.</p>
<p class="e-content">I placed the blog posts and development projects on separate pages to make it easier for viewers to quickly sift through reflections they are most interested in. I also made the card design which I had originally only used on my blog posts page, a consistent theme throughout my website. That way, when the user is deciding which project/essay they would like to view, they are first met with a page of cards, containing their options. This makes it easier for users to sift through the website as quickly as possible so that they can access just the pages they are interested in.</p>

    My colour scheme was inspired by the background image I chose throughout the website. That is the screenshot of some code. I liked the blue of the IDE and then used the same saturation for the other colours. I thought the purple and red stood out on top of the blue but still worked well with the blue. The green just looked really lovely as part of the transition and was light enough to let the text over it stand out.</p>
<p>
    I wanted to keep the layout of my index page, simple as it is the first page my user sees when entering my website. So I just added a welcome note as well as some pixel art which I used throughout my website. With the text heavy pages, I centered the text and added a gradient background to allow the text to stand out. For my portfolio pages, I placed images above text, to indicate that the text was more of a support to the items I had developed. I did not want recruiters who have multitudes of portoflios to scan to feel the need to scan through all of the text just to find the game link/images.
