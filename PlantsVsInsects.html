  <h1>Plants vs Insects</h1>
<span class="p-gameDescription">
    <p>  
      My prototype, Plants Vs Insects is based on the game, Plants vs Zombies. The goal of this project was to investigate how altering certain systems within the game would affect gameplay. I have created 4 different variations of my prototype, Plants vs. Insects. In each version I have a specific part of the system and recorded my observations from playesting.</p>

Overall Improvements 
</h4>

<p>
The You won panel comes up too early which results in the panel not visually communicating that the goal of variations 1,2 and 4 is to destroy all of the insects on the screen. The panel appears when the last insect has been defeated as the gameObject is not destroyed before the scene has changed. I tried to solve this by only triggering the You Won scene when all of the insects were instantiated and no object with the tag insect can be found in the scene. I also created a coroutine which waits for a couple of seconds before switching scenes to the panel. The wait can only be observed in certain scenarios when the player is clearly winning and the insects are destroyed early in their path, but is very difficult to see when multiple insects are in the process of attacking a plant. 	

The hexagon design for the plant plots was inspired by the game plant plants by Nigel on Itch. 		<br/><br/>
</p>
		
<h4 class="Heading2">
Variation 1 (Base Game) 
</h4>

<p>
My aim with this variation was to create the common denominator of all the features I had wanted in my different variations. Initially, my plan was to create 3 completely different variations based on the original, plants vs zombies but with their own twist. For example, one variation would have contained plants whose strength was dependent on the rows they were placed in. Another would have had insects which changed lanes as well as the ability to switch plants with one another. However, I realised all these variations required completely different systems which would have overscoped the project well over the 9 hours I had. I then decided to only include the elements which made the game plants vs zombies. I identified these systems as the shop, insect movement and attack, plant money generation and plant attack system. From there, I worked on stripping elements from this first variation to make the other variations.

I chose not to disable the plant weapons when insects are eating the plants, because that would mean the player automatically loses when plants are eating the last plant. Unlike plants vs zombies there is no last defence e.g. the lawnmower to give the player a fighting chance to still redeem themselves/give them another chance to win.
</p>


<h4 class="Heading2">
Variation 2 
</h4>
<p>
In variation 2, I took out the defense plant and only made the attack plants available in the shop. I found that this variation required less money from the player even though the defense plant was neither the cheapest nor the most expensive plant. This seems to reflect that the defense plant is not the best value for money between all of the plants. I tried to make the costs more balanced with value by reducing the cost of the defense plant from R180 to R100. I could have improved the money imbalance reducing the amount of money plants instantiate per second. 
</p>

<h4 class="Heading2">
Variation 3 
</h4>
<p>
In variation 3, I altered what the insects could interact with. The insects can only attack/eat the plant slots instead of the plants. This introduces a new way of challenge for players, as once a plant slot is eaten, it is not regenerated. The insects destroying slots made the game more challenging as the more the insects attacked, the less chance the player had of being able to make a come back. I think this was one of the best variations in terms of challenge as it made it less likely for the player to fill out all the slots near the beginning of the level and then only have to re-purchase plants for the same slot repeatedly until they had defeated all of the insects. As in other variations, once a player has filled all the slots with plants, the money being generated per second is high enough to rule out money as a sense of conflict for the player. 
</p>
<h4 class="Heading2">
Variation 4 
</h4>
<p>
In variation 4, I took out the attack plants and only left the defense plant. I also had to create a new game state to end the game when the player won. Instead of the game ending when all the insects had been defeated, I ended the game when all the players had been instantiated onto the screen. Initially, I tested this variation with a timer, where the player only had to hold the insects off the red line for a certain amount of time but I found this had a similar negative effect as my first iteration (a traffic controller game, where the player had to prevent collisions between oncoming traffic for a certain amount of time). The timer seems to overwhelm players who are not used to the game system. I noticed that players felt rushed and where too distracted by the timer to be able to figure out how to play the game. I also feel in this variation, the insect is constantly moving towards the red line which forces the player to take action without the pressure of a timer anyways. Which is why I decided to take out the timer and only use the number of insects instantiated as a marker for when the game was over. 
</p>
<p>
Variation 4 replaces the challenge of money with the intensity of the insect instantiations.  
I increased the money required in this level from R50 to R5000 as I felt limiting the money would have made the level too difficult and the level could have had unlimited money and still have been challenging. Too many areas of the game would be demanding the player's attention at once, that is, placing the defense plants as well as being distracted by the rate of money generation from the plants. The challenge stems from the rate of instantiation of the insects. Because they can not be attacked from afar, the player needs to keep them away from the red line as long as possible. A sort of race against time. Player must keep insects off red line until all have the insects have been instantiated onto the scene. The overall goal is to have all 16 insects on the screen at the same time.

Reflections

<h4 class="Heading2">
Overall 
</h4>
<p>
In most of my variations (1,2 and 3), the player is almost guaranteed to win when all of the slots are filled with plants. Therefore, overall it seems that money is the main sense of conflict for the player as increased plants, also increases the money thus lowering the difficulty level. I could have expanded on this by having a variation with plants which did not generate money per second, so that the player would battle with money throughout the level. 
</p>
<p>
I found that because the difficulty of most of the levels was dependent on the money generation that it was an exponential increase with the number of plants placed. Whilst the cost of the plants stayed the same. However, I didn't want to make the game too challenging at the beginning but not hard enough at the end. If the player gets to a point where all of the land slots contains a plant, there would much more money than necessary. However, if they are struggling to fill the land slots, money generation may be too slow for them to regain control of the game.  
</p>
<p>
I also found players were more likely to purchase the R50 plant, even though it generated R5 per 3 seconds as opposed to the second R120 plant which generated R15 per 5 seconds. While looking at the statistics it's easy to see that the second plant is the better decision financially if the player does not need money straight away, but because the rands generated per second is hidden information, it's easy for players to purchase the cheaper one thinking they're saving money. 
</p>
<p>
I also felt that because all of the variations had insects moving at the same pace, that the game felt stiff when played multiple times. However, it did make it easier to identify differences in variations, when the insect attacking/movements were exactly the same in all use cases. However, I think using the random.range function would have improved the levels. I also think having a variation with both the insects which eat plant slots and only defense plants would have been an interesting combination to test. 
</p>
<p>
The most complex system for me to build was the shop system. The first issue I had was figuring out the most efficient way for the player to select which way to place a plant. Initially, I thought of creating a drag and drop system but decided against it and opted for one where the player can purchase a plant and then click on the slot they would like to place it (like the original plants vs zombies). Then I struggled to prevent the player from placing multiple plants onto one slot as well as how to prevent the player from paying for multiple slots before they had placed the first one. I managed to fix this by going through each gameObject’s script specifying each slot as non-placable until certain requirements were met.
