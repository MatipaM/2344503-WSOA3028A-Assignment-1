    <h1>WomansFlow - Hackathon Challenge</h1>
    <section class="DevSection grid h-event h-entry">
      

        <p>
            WomansFlow was created as a response to a <b>24 hour hackathon</b> which posed developers with the task of creating an app or website that solved some sort of problem within the healthcare sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            WomansFlow is a mobile application built using react native. The app aims to connect people who are willing to donate sanitary wear to those who need it. Users can report an emergency request or an empty dispensary. A notification is then sent to local users encouragaging them to donate sanitary wear to the reported bin. The app leverages the use of existing infrastructure i.e. sanitary bins located around universities.
