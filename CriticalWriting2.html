Critical Writing Week 2 - Alan Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence Reflection
    </h2>
 
<p> Alan Turing was a Cambridge Mathematician whose paper, ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ changed the way readers thought about machines and their capabilities. One of the main highlights of Turing’s paper is the Turing test. Instead of asking “Can machines think?”, Turing flips this to the imitation game. The imitation game includes three people, a man, a woman and an interrogator. It is the interrogator’s job to select which participant they think is the woman. In Turing’s version, he replaces the woman with a machine to see if the machine would be able to pass for the woman. </p>
     
<p>  Alan Turing then questions his own test by asking whether it is worthy of investigation. I found this approach to be quite interesting as it is easy to get caught up in investigating/prototyping something new for the fun of it. However, questioning the value of an investigation forces the researcher to ask themselves why they want to learn about a certain topic, and how or who it will benefit. This is also useful when coming to a conclusion with your own research as one knows what they are looking out for. </p>
     
    <p>  In the final part of Alan Turing’s paper, he discusses contrary views of the Turing Test. Turing begins with the “Theological Objection”, which is based on the view that God has given the ability to think to humans alone, therefore machines will never have the ability to think. However, I think that another side to this view would require us to question how we define thinking for a human versus thinking for a machine. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, we have seen how it has given the computer the ability to learn and then produce based off data it has been given, this is what we have defined as thinking for a computer. Whereas thinking for a human is not necessarily a product of the input from other’s actions/data but instead a personal endeavour which requires no external input. I think this same line of thinking applies to the argument of consciousness which states that the only way to know that a computer is thinking is to be the computer thinking. </p>
     
        <p>  Another objection is that of the “head in the Sand” which sees the computer’s ability to think as dangerous. I do see this as a legitimate concern, in the same that a computer designed/trained to kill will be danger to others. However, I do not think this is necessarily only a danger of machines that can think but rather a dangerous consequence of machines which are engineered that way. The mathematical objection can prove that they are limitations to discrete-state machines however, I don’t see this as being against the creation of a computer’s ability to think but rather a temporary hurdle to be jumped over. </p>
     
            <p>  Arguments from various disabilities which imply that a computer will not have the ability to do everything are currently correct but then why would we want computers to do everything. This ignores the fact that they are things which can be done that should not be done. Turing also uses this moment to point out how often we overlook errors of functioning within machines which are mechanical/electrical faults which cause the machines to behave differently than designed. Discussions which overlook these errors are instead speaking about abstract machines. Another which also occurs frequently are errors of conclusion which only arise when we associate a specific meaning to the output of a machine. </p>
     
                <p>  An argument that the nervous system can not be mimicked by a discrete state machine as even a small error in the sizing of a nervous impulse on a neutron can make a big difference on an outgoing impulse. State machines may lack this attention to detail as they are no graduations between states. The argument of  ‘informality of behaviour’ highlights how impossible it would be to produce a set of rules for humans, let alone one so detailed that a machine could follow. This is further supported by the quote, “If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life, he would no better than a machine.”. The final argument from extra-sensory perception speaks to  “telepathy”, “clairvoyance” and “precognition” as well as  “psycho-kinesis”. These all stem from the human ability to sense another’s thoughts without verbal communication, again unspoken rules which would be a challenge to program into a computer. </p>
     
                    <p>  The final chapter of his paper, Learning Machines speaks to the future of Artificial Intelligence and how we can create an “unemotional” mode of communication in order to teach child machines (Turing, 1950). <br/><br/>
