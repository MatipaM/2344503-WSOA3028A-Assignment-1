    <h1>
Critical Writing Week 2 - Alan Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence Reflection
    </h1>
<p>Alan Turing was a Cambridge Mathematician whose paper, ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’ layed the foundation for artificial intelligence. One of the main highlights of Turing’s paper is the Turing test. Instead of asking “Can machines think?”, Turing flips this to the imitation game. Of which the first iteration involves three participants, a human, machine and interrogator. It is the interrogator’s job to determine which of the other two participants is human. The second iteration involves a man, a woman and the interrogator. In this case, the interrogator’s job is to select which participant they think is the woman. </p>
<p>Turing’s basis of whether a machine is intelligent is dependent on the machine’s ability to act in way that is indistinguishable from a human. The behavioural patterns displayed by both the human and the machine are judged from a mental standpoint as opposed to a visual one. (Guo, 2015) The Turing test requires that the behavioural performances conducted by the machine are marked by a human interrogator. The interrogator’s results are not only crucial for determining the outcome but also present a large possibility for false positives. As the interrogator’s answer may differ vastly depending on who the interrogator is. </p>
<p>Whether the results determine the machine as intelligent is not only based on the interrogator picking the machine over the human. It is also determined by the number of times the interrogator is tricked in the first imitation game versus the second. If the number of times the interrogator is fooled is similar in both tests, the machine would be seen as more intelligent than if it were only passing one test (Proudfoot, 2013). A possible reason for why the Turing test was so dependent on the response of the interrogator may be because Turing thought of “intelligence as an ‘emotional’ concept” (Proudfoot, 2013). Hence why his test required a “response-dependent approach” (Proudfoot, 2013).</p>
<p>The AI machine suggested by Diane Proudfoot’s journal article titles, ‘Rethinking Turing’s Test’ (2015) is a machine with a large volume of conversations recorded in its database. When the interrogator asks the machine a question, the machine searches through its database and then comes up with the corresponding component of the conversation (Proudfoot, 2015). The author claims that the machine would be preprogramed, therefore presenting itself as intelligent but not actually being so. However, I would propose that if the machine is instead trained with a string of conversations and then from there is trained into producing and picking its own appropriate responses from the list of conversations, then it could be considered intelligent.</p>
<p>Turing’s test aims to provide “proof of intelligence” (Proudfoot, 2015) but does not go so far as to “actually [specify] the behaviour or behavioural dispositions thought to constitute intelligence” (Proudfoot, 2015). Turing questions his own test, asking whether his “new question [is] a worthy one to investigate” (Turing, 1950. I found this approach to be quite interesting as it is easy to get caught up in investigating/prototyping something new for the fun of it. However, questioning the value of an investigation forces the researcher to ask themselves why they want to learn about a certain topic, and how/who it will benefit. </p>
<p>     
    In the final part of Alan Turing’s paper, Turing discusses contrary views of the Turing Test. Turing begins with the “Theological Objection” (Turing, 1950), which is based on the view that God has given the ability to think to humans alone, therefore machines will never think. However, another side to this view would require us to question how we define thinking for humans versus thinking for a machine. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, we have seen how it has given the computer the ability to learn and then produce, based off data it has been given, this is what we have defined as thinking for a computer. Whereas thinking for a human is not necessarily a product of the input from other’s actions/data but instead a personal endeavour which requires no external input. I think this same line of thinking applies to “the argument of consciousness” (Turing, 1950) which states that the only way to know that a computer is thinking is to be the computer thinking. 
    </p>
    <p>Another objection is that of the “Heads in the Sand” (Turing, 1950) which sees the computer’s ability to think as dangerous suggesting that “it is best if man can be shown to be necessarily superior”. I do see this as a legitimate concern, in the same way that a computer designed/trained to kill would be dangerous. However, I do not think this is necessarily only a danger of intelligent machines but rather a consequence of machines which are engineered to be dangerous. </p>
<p>“The Mathematical Objection” (Turing, 1950) can prove that they are limitations to discrete-state machines however, I don’t see this as being against the creation of a computer’s ability to think but rather requires continual advancement of computing technology. “Arguments From Various Disabilities” (Turing, 1950) rightfully claim that “you can make machines do all the things you have mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X” (Turing, 1950). Turing advises that a computer will not have the ability to do everything, but on the other hand why would we want computers to do everything. This ignores the fact that they are things which can be done that should not be done. Turing also uses this moment to point out how often we overlook errors of functioning within machines which are mechanical or electrical faults which cause the machines to behave differently than designed. Discussions which overlook these errors are instead speaking about abstract machines. Abstract machines are “mathematical fictions” (Turing, 1950) which ignore both functional errors and conclusion errors (when an expected output differs from actual output. </p>
<p>The argument “from continuity in the nervous system” (Turing, 1950) suggests that the nervous system cannot be mimicked by a discrete state machine as even a small error in the sizing of a nervous impulse on a neutron can make a big difference on an outgoing impulse. State machines may lack this attention to detail as they are no graduations between states. </p>
<p>The argument of ‘informality of behaviour’ highlights how impossible it would be to produce a set of rules for humans, let alone one so detailed that a machine could follow. This is further supported by the quote, “If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life, he would no better than a machine.”. The final argument from extra-sensory perception speaks to “telepathy”, “clairvoyance” and “precognition” as well as “psycho-kinesis”. These all stem from the human ability to sense another’s thoughts without verbal communication, again unspoken rules which would be a challenge to program into a computer. </p>
